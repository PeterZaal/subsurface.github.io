Instead of formal releases every few months with a cumbersome, manual process, we are switching to pointing our users at the latest nightly builds instead. These are updated after each change that makes it into our main development branch and are therefore always current.

Since these builds are created in a CI/CD system, they aren't signed, so macOS and Windows will show warning messages when installing those, but other than that they are identical to what we used to ship before.

For macOS, Windows, and Android you can find these builds on the [GitHub nightly build page](https://github.com/subsurface/nightly-builds/releases)

Linux: Ubuntu: add `ppa:subsurface/subsurface-daily` to your software sources; the .deb in that PPA can also be installed on sufficiently current versions of *Debian*, *LinuxMint*, and some other Debian derived distributions.

Linux: Fedora: download from our [COPR nightly release page](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dirkhh/Subsurface-test)
